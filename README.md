# 📊 Numerical Analysis & Function Visualization in Python

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project demonstrates **advanced numerical analysis and visualization** using Python. The exercises focus on:
- Graphing functions and derivatives.
- Identifying critical points using **numerical differentiation**.
- Applying Monte Carlo-style precision checks for roots and minima.
- Exploring the behavior of complex functions such as \(y = (x-1)^3\), \(y = \sin(x^2)\), and \(y = x^3-3x\).

Even though these exercises began as in-class homework, this repository presents them in a **portfolio-ready, professional format**, demonstrating strong analytical and programming skills.
